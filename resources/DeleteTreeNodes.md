### Leetcode 1273. Delete Tree Nodes

[Leetcode Premium Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-tree-nodes)

---

A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:

- The number of nodes is `nodes`;
- The value of the `i-th` node is `value[i]`;
- The parent of the `i-th` node is `parent[i]`.

Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nodes <= 10^4`
- `-10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5`
- `parent.length == nodes`
- `parent[0] == -1` which indicates that 0 is the root.
